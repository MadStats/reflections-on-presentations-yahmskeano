# reflections-on-presentations

For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 



Title of presentation:Fragile Families

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Lots of arduous work cleaning the data, a tough task

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: The sheer size and messiness makes it 
difficult to determine if some variable cuts and directions are correct moves



Title of presentation: Mass Shootings

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Fantastic, and plentiful, visualizations

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: Why cluster with the response variable to predict the same response?





Title of presentation: votings (self-review)

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Everything was fantastic

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: Nothing



Title of presentation:Yelp!

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:Very specific problems considered and answered well

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: Why group distance in 5 ways when you're interested in just Local, Neighboring and Travelling customers.


Title of presentation: Crime in Chi-town

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Good preliminary (maps+TS plots) visualizations to focus the beginning analyses' structures

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: A lot of variables in the final model to interpret



Title of presentation: Games!

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:The objective of the project is grand in scale. Acheiving even marginal predictive abilitiy over 50/50 is difficult in a massive game which is likely tuned to be as balanced as possible.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: I'm unsure how player performance was factored out. Are these proposed 5 champion combinations best in a vacuum or are the 5 champion combinations that are on the opposing team a matchup factor that is considered?


Title of presentation: H~1B

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:Radar comparison is good and informative comparison between dem/rep. However perhaps a few of the variables near 0 for both dem and rep could be shed from the final visualization as with that much info it's a bit messy. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: Key predictor of # of companies with H-1B employees could be affected by some counties simply having more companies of that stature/level. 


Title of presentation: TRAFFIC

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Very extensive residual analysis, and a nice, well-defined
unit of analysis. Also a good job making sense of several data sources.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: A few plots could use some less messy
visualisation (keep outlier points, but consider a different method of conveying a mass of overlapping points, like add an alpha term for non outliers). 
Including a factor variable to separate areas/counties which have unique rates. Are there neighboring counties
with similar residuals?



Title of presentation: Playing with lyrics

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:Neat word cloud use and general data exploration!
Intuitive results, and an overall fascinating direction and concept.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: Sentiment analysis has its limitations
in its objectivity but that is likely unavoidable. Unfortunate that the time constraint limited the presentation.



Title of presentation: NBA

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Lots of fun, varied goals that were well executed.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: I'm not sure what the main focus
was or if there was one. This is mostly fine as I think the quantity of analyses didn't detract from the quality 
of each. A few graphs were excellent(shot/heat maps), a few were clunky(salary mostly).


Title of presentation: Terrorism  

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Many intriguing visualizations that warrant more time to explore, the animations especially. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: What is the change in how these
attacks are reported? Surely over the course of ~40 years the data is inconsistent. Consider determining if model
is consistent over various stretches of years.
